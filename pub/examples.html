    <!------- Loading JS scripts ------->
    <!-- When loading JS scripts, considerations should be made regarding when
         the DOM is being loaded, and when different scripts 
         depend on each other. Below are examples of a few different ways to load the scripts.

     -->

    <!-- Load any CSS before the JS in case you need to access styles in your scripts. -->

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="notify.css" />

    <script defer type="text/javascript" src="Notify.js"></script>
    <script defer type="text/javascript" src="examples.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="header">
      <h1>Notify</h1>
      <h2>A simple way to communicate music through the web!</h2>
    </div>
    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <a href="./documentation.html">Documentation</a>
    <h2>Write music!</h2>
    <p>
      Select on a note on the staff and change the pitch/time value of the notes
      through the UI. You can also change the time signature of the staff and
      the notes will be adjusted accordingly. Add and remove as many bars as you
      need, the staff will add/remove rows for the bars. Try editing the staff below.
    </p>


    <div id="staff1"></div>

    <h2>Play it!</h2>
    <p>Now that you've written some music on the staff, click the "Play from Start"
      button in the UI to play the notes! By default, the speed is 120 BPM for a quarter
      note, but you can adjust the speed as you need.
    </p>


    <h2>Hide the UI</h2>
    <p>
      You can also choose to hide the UI if needed! Here is an instance of the
      library without the UI. You can still select notes to play it and get data
      of it. Try selecting a note below and press the "Show Note" button to see 
      which note you pressed in the console.
    </p>
    <div id="staff2"></div>
    <button id="staff2getNote">Show Note</button>
    <h3>Press the button to view the staff's notes on the console!</h3>

    <h2>Get some data!</h2>
    <p>You can get the data of the notes on the staff. Press the "VIEW STAFF" 
      button to get all of the notes in the staff as an array
    </p>

    <button id="staff2button">VIEW STAFF</button>
